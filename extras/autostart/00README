The Autostart mechanism is a specification of freedesktop.org, implemented by
many Linux desktop managers, including LXDE, the default desktop environment for
the Raspberry Pi's Raspbian operating system.

The files in this directory allow various DerbyNet-related applications to be
automatically started by copying the corresponding desktop file to the user's
.config/autostart folder, e.g., to /home/pi/.config/autostart/.  (It may be
necessary first to create the .config/autostart/ folder.)

It's unlikely that you would want to autostart ALL the files in this folder.
