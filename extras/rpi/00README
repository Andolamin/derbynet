Utilities for Raspberry Pi
==========================

About the /boot Partition
-------------------------

The Raspberry Pi boots from an SD or micro-SD card.  The card includes a
small-ish /boot partition plus a larger main partition.  While the main
partition uses one of the Linux-only 'ext' file systems, the /boot partition is
a vfat file system.  This means the /boot partition can be read and written by
Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.

When installed on a Raspberry Pi, the DerbyNet package installs two small files
in the /boot partition.  These files are intended to be edited by the user.
Placing them in the /boot partition makes it possible to change network
parameters, server address, and passwords without having to bring keyboard,
mouse, and monitor to attach to the Raspberry Pi.  Rather, with the Pi powered
off, mount the SD card in a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine, and edit the
configuration files directly in the /boot partition; then replace the card in
the Pi and reboot.
