DerbyNet Timer (JavaScript)
class Detector
// A detector is a regex that triggers an event upon matching.  The generated
// event may include strings picked up from the match.  In some cases, instead
// of (or in addition to) generating an event after a match, the detector may
// try applying some "internal" detectors to the parse the matched string into
// separate events.

class TimerEvent
// Different objects involved in managing the timer communicate with each other
// via events.  Event handlers get registered in one static list, and an event
// gets sent to all registered handlers.  Events can also be scheduled for
// delivery at a future time, specified either by absolute time or milliseconds
// in the future.

class HostPoller
// The host poller handles the communication with the web server.  Messages from
// the server get converted into timer events (e.g., PREPARE_HEAT_RECEIVED or
// ABORT_HEAT_RECEIVED).  The host poller also listens for several events that
// it then reports to the web server.

main.js

class PortWrapper
// A PortWrapper reads from the serial port, dividing the input into lines and
// then applying pattern matchers to each line as it becomes available.  A line
// is considered complete either when a newline character is seen, or after a
// long-enough pause.  The pattern matchers are typically looking for news of
// lane or heat finishes, or possibly news about the start gate being open or
// closed.

ports.js: Event listeners for ‘connect’ and ‘disconnect’ events, mostly no-ops.

class HeatResult
// Collects individual lane results according to the lane mask.
// Each lane result is a {time:, place:}.

class RoleFinder
// Sends an ajax request for role.list, to get a list of available roles.

serial_port_event_listener.js
// Listener for ipc messages on serial-ports channel,
// sent from the electron script, timer.js, when run as
// a stand-alone application.

class StateMachine
// The state machine keeps track of when a race is running vs when cars are
// being staged or the track is idle.

class TimerProxy
// Combines a port wrapper and a profile.
